# Iron Man Hand
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks and various other files used for Kai Mizuno and Sean Emerson's Capstone Project for CSCI 250: Intro to Sensors, a class at Colorado School of Mines. This is a project where we are developing a glove that a user can put on to simulate using the hand from an Iron Man to shoot a laser beam. This laser beam has an accuracy uncertainty attached to it's algorithm based off how far away the target is, which we process the data for and display/analyze via graphs.
